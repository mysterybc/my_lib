# My_lib

### Some Useful Library I Wrote.

### 1  ROS Action

This is an c++ implement of simple action and server, you can use it to implement your own action, **it could help you implement your action much more efficient.**

- Dependence: Ros Kinetic,  g++
- With demo.

### 2  ROS Service

This is an c++ implement of service client and server, you can use it to implement your own service, this one is not as useful as ROS Action.

- Dependence: Ros Kinetic,  g++
- With Demo.

### PS : 

I'll be very happy if these code could help you~~
